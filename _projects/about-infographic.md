## About Me Infographic

This was my first attempt at using an infographic format for information visualization. The given assignment parameters were to construct a visual story of yourself using information and data rather than pictorial images. I used iCal calendar entries as the data set (simplified and grouped by similar activities), since they provided a thorough view of how my personal time is spent. Additionally, this data aligns with the idea that I define myself through my activities and how I choose to spend my time.

###### **Tools:** Adobe Illustrator
