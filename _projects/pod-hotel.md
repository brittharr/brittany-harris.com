## Pod Hotel

This was designed as a semester long project for my third Architectural Design Studio. I began by looking at the scale of the human body and created a personal pod space with limited functionality (working, resting, and washing). My original design concept came about through analysis of artificial and natural analogues to the pod--respectively a letterpress drawer and nautilus shell. With this pod design, I then moved to the scale of the city, and designed a Pod Hotel sited adjacent to the Highline Park in New York City. This studio also placed an emphasis on developing a non-digital approach to design, giving me a strong foundation in sketching and drawing that I continue to use in my design process.

###### **Tools:** Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop
