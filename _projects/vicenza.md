During Summer 2012 I studied in the Venetian region of Italy through a 6-week program with the UVA Architecture School. The goal of the program was to develop freehand drawing abilities and skills of observation. I analyzed and drew Italian architectural prototypes, as well as more universal architectural conditions. After returning from the program, I curated and organized my drawings, then learned bookbinding techniques to create a finished product.

###### **Tools:** Adobe InDesign, Photoshop
