## Image Processor

In Computer Graphics, I employed a studied theory of image processing to create a console application that applies interesting filters to existing images. The program iterates through pixel data of the input image and changes the data based on the specified filter.

###### **Tools:** Emacs

###### **Technologies:** C++
