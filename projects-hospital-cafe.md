## Hospital Cafe

Our studio went on a site visit to the Washington Heights neighborhood in New York City. A problem that I observed with the neighborhood was a lack of healthy, local food options--forcing hospital workers and visitors to leave the neighborhood or eat at unhealthy fast food restaurants. My proposed answer to this issue was to fill the hospital courtyard with modular Caf&eacute;s as healthier food options.

###### **Tools:** Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop
