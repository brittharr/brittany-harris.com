## Ray Tracer

After studying how ray tracing works as a method of image rendering, I wrote a console application that renders a given scene. Basic geometries (triangle, sphere, cylinder, cone, and box) and light sources (point, spot, and directional) are recognized. Recursive ray tracing is called upon for reflections, refractions, transparency, and shadows.

###### **Tools:** Emacs

###### **Technologies:** C++
