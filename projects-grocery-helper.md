## Grocery Helper

This application was written for a class on Cloud Computing while learning about PaaS cloud computing services. I used a simple grocery list as a means to store and retrieve images and data from the Google App Engine datastore. Check out the live version [here](http://cs4501-bjh3ev-groceries.appspot.com).

###### **Tools:** PyCharm, Google App Engine

###### **Technologies:** Python, HTML, CSS
