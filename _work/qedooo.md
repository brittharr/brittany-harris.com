        <p><a href="http://www.qedooo.com">QEDOOO</a> was created as the result of a 3 a.m. jam sesh at the <a href="http://www.boostlabs.com">Boost Labs</a> office. We design and code custom charts for each of our clients to support their needs (and branding) … but we were starting to notice overlap where clients ask for visuals that they have spotted in our portfolio.</p>
        <p>This product started as a way for us to rapidly implement our common charts and became a way for us to share our design chops with others in an easy-to-configure <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3</a> extension.</p>
        <p>QEDOOO was quite an experience in the full lifecycle product management and development: from initial ideation and market analysis through marketing and promotion. The architecture and implementation weren’t new to me, but I had interesting exposure to aspects that clients often take care of internally.</p>

        <p>At this point in the product lifecycle, we’re in public beta and are continuing to collect (and incorporate) feedback from our helpful beta testers.</p>
