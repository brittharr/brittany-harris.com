        <p>The <a href="http://www.nbr.org/">National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR)</a> needed a dynamic infographic to showcase the results of their survey and investigation into violence in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Our interdisciplinary team at <a href="http://www.boostlabs.com">Boost Labs</a> conceptualized, designed, and developed a set of visualization "modules" that NBR has been able to embed as a full infographic or in split pieces however they have needed to support their findings.</p>
