{"layout":"project","title":"Pod Hotel","redirect_from":"/projects/pod-hotel.html","description":"Brittany Harris is a front end developer with a lot of feelings about cats, the internet, and cats on the internet.","content":"<p>This was designed as a semester long project for my third Architectural Design Studio. I began by looking at the scale of the human body and created a personal pod space with limited functionality (working, resting, and washing). My original design concept came about through analysis of artificial and natural analogues to the pod--respectively a letterpress drawer and nautilus shell. With this pod design, I then moved to the scale of the city, and designed a Pod Hotel sited adjacent to the Highline Park in New York City. This studio also placed an emphasis on developing a non-digital approach to design, giving me a strong foundation in sketching and drawing that I continue to use in my design process.</p>\n<h6 id=\"tools-adobe-illustrator-photoshop\"><strong>Tools:</strong> Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop</h6>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/projects/hotel-section.png\" alt=\"Hotel section taken through Highline Park, NYC\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/projects/analogues.png\" alt=\"Analogues -- Letterpress Drawer and Nautilus Shell\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/projects/pod.png\" alt=\"Plans and sections of pod design\"></p>\n"}
